- Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
- Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
- Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
- Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
- If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
- See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
